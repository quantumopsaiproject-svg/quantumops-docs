# QuantumOps AI – Product Vision

QuantumOps AI is an AI-powered monitoring and automation platform for Proof-of-Stake validators.

## Core Goals

- **Monitor**: Collect metrics, logs, and chain data from validator nodes.
- **Automate**: Provide safe self-healing actions (restart, peer fix, upgrades).
- **Assist (AI)**: Explain errors, suggest fixes, analyze logs, and find risks.

## Phase 1 Target

Focus on Cosmos-based networks, starting with a Fetch.ai (FET) testnet validator.

## Long-Term Vision

Become the AI-driven operations layer for all major PoS ecosystems and validator companies.
